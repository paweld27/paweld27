- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paweld27

This repository contains some snippets that I have written in Python for desktop applications and in C for microcontrollers. Most often, these applications are used to analyze and display measurement data from various sensors. These are specialized applications designed to support the operator's decision-making process and are intended to replace Matlab-based applications.
