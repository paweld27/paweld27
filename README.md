- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paweld27

This repository contains fragments of programs/applications that I have written in Python. Most often, these applications are used to analyze and display measurement data from various sensors. These are specialized applications designed to support the operator's decision-making process and are intended to replace Matlab-based applications.
Since I learned everything about interactive applications based on Matplotlib or Bokeh (my favorite libraries) by browsing the Internet, I am also posting various code snippets. Perhaps they will be useful to other seekers.
